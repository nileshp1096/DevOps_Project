Web Application Deployment with Load Balancing and Automation using Jenkins and Docker Swarm

Project Workflow:
1. Developers commit code changes to a version control repository (e.g., Git).
2. Jenkins monitors the repository for new commits and triggers the build process when changes are detected.
3. Jenkins fetches the code, builds the Docker images for the application, and pushes them to a container registry.
4. Docker Swarm uses the Docker images to create and manage service instances of the web application across the cluster nodes.
5. NGINX load balancer routes incoming traffic to the different instances of the web application, ensuring even distribution and preventing overload on any single instance.
6. Grafana is configured to collect and visualize metrics and logs from the Docker Swarm cluster. It provides real-time insights into the performance and health of the application
